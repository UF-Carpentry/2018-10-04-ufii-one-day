  The <a href="https://www.uf-carpentry.org">UF Carpentries Club</a> is offering a one day workshop to help the
  UF community get started learning R. Need to learn some programming for a class? Have data
  you're scared to work with in Excel? Want to collaborate effectively with your peers?
  We were there once too. Come start learning with us.
</p>
<p>
  Our instructors are trained by the Carpentries in evidence-based pedagogy and our 
  materials have been developed collaboratively over years by dozens of contributors.
  The <a href="https://informatics.institute.ufl.edu/">University of Florida Informatics Institute</a>
  and <a href="https://biodiversity.institute.ufl.edu/">Biodiversity Institute</a>
  have generously volunteered space and resources for this workshop in order to
  advance the skillset of the UF community. The organizers, instructors, and helpers 
  are volunteering their time to help UF, and you!

  The international <a href="http://datacarpentry.org">Data Carpentry</a> organization
  develops and teaches workshops on the fundamental data skills needed to conduct 
  research. Our mission is to provide researchers high-quality, domain-specific 
  training covering the full lifecycle of data-driven research. Our lessons are domain 
  specific, from life and physical sciences to social science and build on the existing 
  knowledge of learners to enable them to quickly apply skills learned to their own 
  research. Our initial target audience is learners who have little to no prior computational 
  experience. We create a friendly environment for learning to empower researchers and enable 
  data driven discovery.
